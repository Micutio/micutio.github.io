This week has been fun as I implemented the tooltips that appear when hovering world entities, ui elements like buttons and the player DNA that wraps around the right side of the screen.

For now the tooltip contains some information that is important to the player, for example whether their receptors match and therefore direct interaction is possible. In the future I plan to include more information, but limit visibility depending on the quality and quantity of sensors the player cell has.

This is part of the full mouse support for the game. Now I'm wondering whether I should create a way to inspect for players that only use the keyboard.
