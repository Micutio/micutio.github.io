The engine migration and substantial UI overhaul are finished now and finalised in Alpha release 0.0.4! Much has changed under the hood, in terms of rendering and I/O processing. I'm very happy with fact that my software architecture is sound enough that the gameplay code remained virtually untouched and still functions like nothing happened. Separation of concerns, baby!

As for the UI, the [before](https://imgur.com/yx9OBHY) and [after](https://imgur.com/AVqC8zw) comparison gives an impression of how much has changed. The sidebar fits much better that a narrow bottom panel, especially the log can show many more entries. Innit's core feature, every object in the game being based on manipulatable DNA, has a more prominent representation with the player DNA wrapping  around the top, right and bottom of the side panel as it grows. Each gene also shows a tooltip when being hovered over with the mouse. The color palette has been adjusted and refined and while it's not close to final  I probably want to keep it a fleshy pink.

After this big round of engine changes it's now finally time to add some more content before I want to publish a playable alpha test. Besides the viruses there should be at least a primitive immune system with one or two different cell types and also bacteria to complete the core trifecta of viruses, bacteria and immune cells.
