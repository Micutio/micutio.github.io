Quote myself, last week:

> Ideally I'd have a working version of the gene manipulator by the end of next week.

In short, it's close to done but needs more polish. The main source of complication this time is getting it to work with keyboard and mouse controls alike. This fell a bit behind because I spent the last days implementing the UI, rendering and keyboard controls first.

Additionally the gene info box at the bottom of the window will also show a bit-wise representation of the gene to make it more apparent when one of them is flipped using the mutation function.

Finally, after mulling over the aging mechanic I feel like it's the right thing to do. Requiring a cell renewal once every so often or risking aging effects like damage to the genome as a downside ought to balance well with giving the player the freedom to choose when to regenerate using the genome that has been altered by the player, aging and possibly other lifeforms around it.
