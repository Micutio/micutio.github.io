Last week I received lots of helpful and encouraging feedback in my introductory post, which I then reflected on during my daily commutes.

Since then I have been polishing the in-game menus and a basic color theme to put everything in place for the first tests of the DNA mechanic. If all goes well I should have a working prototype by next weekend.

The community here is really kind and helpful, so thanks again to all of you! After initial hesitation I'm very glad I put my project out here, after all.
