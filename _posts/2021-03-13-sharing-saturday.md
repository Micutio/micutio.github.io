Starting into 2021 was slow for various reasons, mostly not being in the right mindset and therefore easily getting distracted and getting stuck.

However things are looking up and now that the most egregious offenders are fixed, I'm going to implement some QoL features that help with understanding the game better.

Chiefly there is need for tooltips, which may vary in detail depending on quality and/or quantity of sensors on your cell. This is necessary to gather information about other cells and viruses in order to adjust your own genome to fight or help them.

Secondly I'm looking into creating a genome editor that can be used to edit your genes ingame to change your attributes and available actions.

Once these items are checked the game should be a whole lot closer to alpha status.
