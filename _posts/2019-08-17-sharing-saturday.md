Not many new things to show for this week, as I've been continuing work at the DNA and character traits system. During my research I stumbled upon the wiki of the old *Creatures* video game series. By the looks of it the developers put quite [sophisticated](https://creatures.fandom.com/wiki/ChiChi_Norn_Genome) genetics into these. Too bad a lot of the detail is missing as this could have been quite a treasure trove to dive into. Nevertheless there is still much to take away from the bits and pieces there.
