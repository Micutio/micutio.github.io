The last two weeks were spent mulling over the AI system and how to implement something other than just passing the turn. Now I'm feeling like getting somewhere: actions have been equipped with meta information about valid targets. This allows me to implement a randomised ai, the first one that will actually do something by picking random actions with random valid targets.

Eventually the complete AI - available actions AND decision making - will be determined by an object's genetic code. So that's gonna be fun to figure out. But we're getting there step b step.
